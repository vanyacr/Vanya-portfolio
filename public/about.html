<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Vanya C R, a Computer Science undergraduate at PES University and a Reliance Foundation Scholar.</p>

<p>I’m passionate about building impactful tech solutions by exploring the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and real-world applications. I’ve worked on projects involving assistive technologies and academic platforms, and I'm currently expanding my skills in Web Development to create more interactive, user-friendly solutions.</p>

<p>With a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving, I enjoy learning by doing — turning ideas into functional systems that make a difference. Whether it's developing full-stack applications or exploring intelligent systems, I'm always eager to grow and contribute meaningfully to the tech space. Let’s connect, collaborate, or just geek out about tech, languages, or K-dramas!</p>
